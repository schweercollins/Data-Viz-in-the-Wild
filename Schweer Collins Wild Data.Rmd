# Visualization One


[National Park Attendance by Year and Park](https://samveverka.shinyapps.io/NationalParksAttendance/)


- Desgined for anyone

- Particularly for those interested in R visualization with shiny apps

- Purpose is to describe changes in national park attendance over the past century

---

#Uses the following packages:

```{r package}
# library(shiny)
# library(reshape2)
# library(ggvis)
# library(dplyr)
# library(DescTools)
```


---

##Strengths 

![strength](strengths.JPG)

- Interactive: can change the dates, attendance rate, and park



- Synthesizes a large amount of data



- Simple 

---



##Improvements



- Create a drop-down menu for national park names 



- Use scale_y_log() to improve visibility of data from parks with lower attendance



- Make it color blind friendly: make all park lines in gray, color or highlight selected park lines



- An option to highlight one park in relation to all others; as it is, only the selected park line shows up

- An option to select multiple parks for comparison (example: National Parks in the Northwest)

#Visualization Two: Parent-Child Relationships



- Academic Audience

- Communicates that parents are *most* likely to respond to negative child behavior with positive skills; whereas parents are *equally* likely to respond to appropriate child behavior with positive or negative skills.

```{r 4, echo = FALSE, }
knitr::include_graphics("hackman.JPG")
```

##Strength

- The side by side comparison; visualization would be less effective with only one comparison



---

```{r 3, echo = FALSE, fig.retina=2 }
knitr::include_graphics("hackman.JPG")
```
##Improvements

- Take out neutral child behavior, maybe even neutral parent behavior

- Add color to the bars for positive and negative parent responses

- Relabel y-axis - percent is confusing - perhaps total number?

- Reorder so that positive parent responses (i.e., highest bar) is first

- Relabel the figure
